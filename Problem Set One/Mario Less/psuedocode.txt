pseudocode for mario (less)

                            Part 1:

1. Ask the user for the number of stair cases. (DO)
2. If the number is not between 1 and 8, then ask again. (WHILE)

                            Part 2:

1. Initialize the number of spaces. (int space = 0)
2. Make a FOR loop for the number of rows.
        |
        |   think of it like this: when you type, you type the 'columns'
        |   first rather than the rows. columns you press space and rows
        |   you press enter.
        |
3. Make the start value of the for loop to be 1 and you can add one to stairs
        |
        |   like: for (int i = 1; i < numberOfStairs + 1; i++)
        |
4. Change the value of spaces to be one less than the numberOfStairs
        |
        |   space = numberOfStairs - 1
        |
5. Print the number of spaces for space times in a WHILE loop.
6. Print "#", i amount of times in a new FOR loop.
7. Print a new line, out of the loop.
